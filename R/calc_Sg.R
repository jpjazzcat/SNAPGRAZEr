#' @title Biomass at the end of grazing episode
#'
#' @description Calculation of the parameter Sg, the biomass at the end of grazing episode, from Ritchie (2020)
#' @param Sk The steady state of biomass in the absence of grazing for a given location. This should ideally be measured directly using grazing exclosures.
#' @param Se Biomass at the start of grazing episode. Output of calc_Se.
#' @param Lg Biomass loss during grazing episode. Output of calc_Lg.
#' @param Ddays Number of days of grazing episode
#' @param n Number of "pastures" per total area, A.
#' @param d Stocking density (head/ha)
#' @param r Maximum relative growth rate of plant biomass. Can be calculated as the y-intercept of the relationship between the measured relative growth rate and plant biomass over the growing season. Default for tropical grasslands is 0.05 and for temperate grasslands is 0.035.
#' @param W Average animal body size (kg live weight)
#' @param Cg Daily consumption rate (g/animal/day)
