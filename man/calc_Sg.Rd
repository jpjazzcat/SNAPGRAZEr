\title{Biomass at the end of grazing episode}
\usage{
calc_Sg(Sk, Se, Lg, Ddays, n, d, r, W = NA, Cg = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{Sk}{The steady state of biomass in the absence of grazing for a given location. This should ideally be measured directly using grazing exclosures.}

\item{Se}{Biomass at the start of grazing episode. Output of calc_Se.}

\item{Lg}{Biomass loss during grazing episode. Output of calc_Lg.}

\item{Ddays}{Number of days of grazing episode}

\item{n}{Number of "pastures" per total area, A.}

\item{d}{Stocking density (head/ha)}

\item{r}{Maximum relative growth rate of plant biomass. Can be calculated as the y-intercept of the relationship between the measured relative growth rate and plant biomass over the growing season. Default for tropical grasslands is 0.05 and for temperate grasslands is 0.035.}

\item{W}{Average animal body size (kg live weight)}

\item{Cg}{Daily consumption rate (g/animal/day)}
}
